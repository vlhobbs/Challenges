# Challenges

A repository for various projects I've attempted in various programming languages. 

- TruckChecker.java

An old working way of keeping track of trucks in an imaginary trucking fleet. Keeping it to practice "cleaning" up my code. 
The hard part with this one is going to be remember exactly what I had in mind with this code, since I have lost the challenge itself.
I'll have more to add to this later.
